    st.markdown("<div style='text-align: justify;'>Significant economic and social changes are being brought about by the steadily rising urbanization of cities, which presents a number of difficulties for service and management providers. Especially in places with greater rates of crime, adequately addressing public safety is an increasingly difficult task. To manage this intricacy, novel technologies are being providing police forces with more access to crime-related data volumes that can be examined in order to identify trends and patterns. These technological advancements could enhance the effective use of police resources within a certain area and eventually encourage more efficient deterrence of crime.</div>" , unsafe_allow_html=True , help="Source: Abstract")
